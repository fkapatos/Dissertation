## ðŸ“Š Overview

This project investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini, and o3-mini to predict whether a company's earnings will increase or decrease in the next fiscal year, based purely on standardised and anonymised financial statement data (balance sheets and income statements). Inspired by Kim et al. (2024), this project replicates and extends their work by:

- Testing multiple prompting strategies (simple vs. Chain-of-Thought).
- Evaluating reasoning vs. non-reasoning models.
- Assessing the impact of historical data length (up to 8 years).
- Comparing performance to professional human financial analysts.
